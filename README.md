#DnD_Character

This project servers as a school assignemnt. It was started with the intention of finishing it for myself and perhaps for my friends with whom I played D&D. Unfortunatelly, during this time (it was in my last semester) we started playing less and less... until eventualy we stop playin, mainly due to time. 

Therefore this project has been abbadoned and won't be finished (unless something else comes)
